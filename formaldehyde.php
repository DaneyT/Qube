            <p>
                Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an colorless, strong-smelling gas used in making building materials and many household products. It is used in pressed-wood products, such as particleboard, plywood, and fiberboard; glues and adhesives; permanent-press fabrics; paper product coatings; and certain insulation materials. It is also used to make other chemicals.

            <h2><span class="subhead">When is Formaldehyde harmful?</span></h2>
            <p>
                Average formaldehyde levels in homes are ranging from 0.10 to 3.68 parts per million (ppm).  Newly manufactured or mobile homes are usually at the high end of the spectrum.
                The reference dose for formaldehyde is 0.2 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day.

            <p>
                Exposure to low levels of formaldehyde can burn the eyes, throat, nose and skin. Long term exposure can cause cancer of the nose, throat and blood. High exposure to formaldehyde can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, bronchitis, severe shortness of breath and a rapid heart rate. People with respiratory problems like asthma may be more sensitive to exposure to formaldehyde.

            <h2><span class="subhead">Measures against Formaldehyde exposure</span></h2>
            <p>
                Formaldehyde levels in homes can be reduced by: ventilating, not smoking inside, moderating temperatures and reducing the humidity levels through the use of air conditioners and dehumidifiers.
                Using exterior-grade pressed-wood products limits formaldehyde levels in your home due to the different chemicals used to produce these products. It is also advisable to ask about the formaldehyde content of products when buying building materials or furniture.
