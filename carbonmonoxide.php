        <h2><span class="subhead">What is CO?</span></h2>
        <p>
            CO (Carbon Monoxide) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. About half of the unintentional deaths from CO poisoning are from the inhalation of smoke from fires and vehicle exhausts gasses. Another big source are heaters/boilers which are installed in many homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-fatal unintentional poisonings happens from incomplete combustion processes of organic fossil fuels. Incomplete combustion of oil, gas or coal are a common environmental source of CO.  Normal conditions are when oxygen is present, when oxygen is present the combustion process will produce carbon. However, when oxygen is lacking in the air, the combustion process or the heating appliance will produce CO which can be fatal.

        <h2><span class="subhead">When is CO harmful?</span></h2>
        <p>
            Once Carbon Monoxide has been breathed in, it replaces the oxygen in the blood. Inhalation of CO can result in brain damage, heart problems, major organ dysfunction, memory or cognitive problems, behavioral and personality changes and a range of other permanent problems.
            One of the dangers of Carbon Monoxide poisoning is death. CO is starting to have a negative effect on a personâ€™s health from nine parts per million(ppm) and onward, with increasingly greater harmful effects until it can kill within minutes (30 minutes at 6400 ppm).
            CO takes thousands of lives all around the world every year and most people die without ever knowing, they simply went unconsciousness and never come around or fell asleep and never wake up due to CO inhalation.

        <h2><span class="subhead">Measures against CO exposure</span></h2>
        <p>
            Never sit or sleep in an unventilated room. Preemptive matters are to not use a gas stove or oven to heat your home. In addition check your chimney flues and vents regularly for any blockages. Furthermore always follow the instructions for the use of fuel-burning devices and do not burn any fuel in enclosed spaces.
            When you are experiencing: a dull headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath, confusion, blurred vision or loss of conscious, seek fresh air and contact your doctor immediately. The last tip is to never leave your car engine running in the garage as it can build up fumes quickly and seep through the cracks in your home.
