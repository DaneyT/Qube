            <p>
                Methane is a relative abundant natural gas commonly used as fuel. Methane is on contrary to popular belief a colorless and odorless gas. Methane is not only poisonous when mixed with other gases but is also a high inflammable and explosive gas. Methane is commonly encountered in large quantities in homes when there is a gas leak or faulty equipment.

            <h2><span class="subhead">When is methane harmful?</span></h2>
            <p>
                Methane poisoning happens when you come into contact with methane through inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Methane is harmful in environments which are badly ventilated, because methane will deprive the room of oxygen causing suffocation. Methane gas can be poisonous in ideal circumstances  when mixed with other gasses. And as explained in the paragraph above, methane can be explosive when the concentration reaches 40.000 parts per million or more.

            <p>
                Methane is commonly being supplied into your home through a gas pipe. Methane can accumulate in your home if you leave the stove on, have leaking gas pipes and or boilers/heaters.  It is important to check your pipes regularly and to keep ventilating your house properly.
