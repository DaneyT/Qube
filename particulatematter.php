            <p>
                Particulate matter (PM) also known as particulates or fine dust is a harmful substance.
                PM is commonly found in traffic, in the vicinity of industrial complexes and in houses.
                PM is a name for a collection of  different kind of dust like particles like scoot, smoke, Sahara sand, tire pieces, manure, fireworks, fireplaces, laser printers and even sea salt.  PM are little particles not bigger than a few micrometers. Particles that are bigger than 10 micrometers cause the least damage. Particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers bypasses our bodily defenses and can wreak havoc in our airways.

            <p>
                Inhalation of particulate matter causes infections in the lungs. This makes it more difficult to absorb oxygen and increases the chance on lung cancer. The infections also increases the amount of free radicals in your blood which increases your changes on a stroke or cardiac arrest. People who are extra sensitive for particulate matter are the elderly, heart patients and people who already have respiratory problems.

            <p>
                As with dangerous gases, it is advisable to ventilate your home correctly. Other measures you can take is to stop smoking and donâ€™t use a fireplace unless it is correctly ventilated. Some point out that eating antioxidants helps the body defend against PM. In the worst case you can equip yourself with a mouth cover. It also helps if you move outside of the city and or major industrial complexes or roads where there is less particulate matter in the air.
